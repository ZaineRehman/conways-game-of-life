# Conway's Game of Life! 

This is a pretty old project so unfortunately the code lacks proper comments. It was also supposed to have some sort of threading but the implementation I did didn't work so I permanently set it to 1 thread. Maybe sometime in the future I'll revisit this, but for now I'll leave it as is. It's still pretty fun to play around with. 

### Controls
##### note: all keys are on keypad
```
[left mouse] - place/remove pixel
[right mouse] - drag place/remove pixel

[/] - increase frame delay
[*] - decrease frame delay
[.] - set frame delay to 0

[-] - fill screen with random pixels, 50% filled
[+] - fill screen with random pixels, 25% filled
[1] - small pixel size
[2] - medium pixel size
[3] - large pixel size

[4] - standard game logic
[5] - game logic tweaked for more growth
[6] - game logic tweaked for less growth

[7] - black and white colors
[8] - color scheme 1
[9] - color scheme 2

[0] - clear screen

[enter] - pause
```

### Below are a few screenshots that highlight some of the functionality

*A different color gradient option, as well as a smaller cell size*
